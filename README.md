## Project Overview
The aim of the project is to provide insight and recommendations to Microsoft Company on their new movie-making business proposal. In order to make informed recommendations, I will explore financial data for high-profit-making genres and their unique characteristics. With the findings, I will make data-driven suggestions to the Microsoft Company stakeholders.
### Business Problem

Which type of movies and genres should Microsoft consider to maximize its Return on Investment?

### The Data

Information is extracted from the following files:

* imdb. title.basics
* imdb. title.ratings
* bom.movie_gross

### Questions to consider

Is the movie industry a profitable venture?
Which is the genre with the highest Return on Investment(RoI)?
Which is the best season to release movies with high RoI?

### 1. Is the movie industry a profitable venture?

There is significant variability in the ROI data, with a mean of 6.19 and a standard deviation of 19.59. The top half of performers have an ROI of 3% or higher, indicating that they roughly double their investment. This is a good indicator that movie industry is a profitable venture. Now, I need to look at the characteristics of the genres with the highest returns to advise further.


### 2. Which genres have the greatest Return on Investment?
From the analysis obtained, it indicates that Horror, Mystery, Musical, Documentary, and Thriller have the leading Return on Investment. I strongly advise you to consider any of these genres for production.

### 3. What is the best season to release movies with high ROI?

From the above presentation, the movies with the highest ROI were released during the summer. This seems to be the best season to release movies.

## Recommendations
1. There is significant variability in the ROI data, with a mean of 6.19 and a standard deviation of 19.59. The top half of performers have an ROI of 3% or higher, indicating that they roughly double their investment. This is a good indicator that the movie industry is a profitable venture. It is a recommendable business industry to venture into.

2. Horror, Mystery, Musical, Documentary, and Thriller have the leading Return on Investment. I strongly advise you to consider any of these genres during production. When wanting to limit production budget, produce horror movies, since they have some of the lowest budgets with a high rate of return.

3. Consider summer releases as compared to the other seasons.

4. Further research into streaming markets to determine what movies are most profitable in that domain would be highly beneficial.

5. Examine data from 2020-2021 to see the impact that Covid-19 had on movie trends, as some of these may have a lasting impact on the market.
